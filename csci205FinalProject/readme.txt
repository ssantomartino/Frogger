About the project:
Our game is Frogger, based off the popular arcade game. Upon running, you are brought to the main menu screen. From there you can select your level of difficulty (corresponds to the speed of the obstacles). Once you hit start the objects begin moving across the screen.


To control the frog you use the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to make it to the lilypads by avoiding the cars in the roads and by riding the logs/turtles in the river and avoid falling in. Once you reach the top you can land safely on a lilypad and bring a new frog across. Once all five lilypads are filled you get a score bonus and the pads are cleared. 


If you get hit by a car or land in the river you lose a life. If you lose all of your lives you are brought to the end game screen. The end game screen displays your score and a list of the ten highest scores. You can select to play again from this screen and it will bring you back to the main menu.
